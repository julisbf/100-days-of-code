# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/), 1st challenge - Drum kit. *Also getting used to **Markdown***

**Thoughts:** I've been using JQuery, so I decided to try build little projects with vanilla js, and found Javascript30. I listened to the objective and then paused the video to come with my solution. Checked MDN web docs to refresh some concepts and complete the challenge. Afterwards watched the solution video, and learned a new way to *access element attributes* (this one I decided to use it on my solution) and *transitionend event*. Good way to be ready for the Calculator App.

### R1D2: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started with *Calculator App* (eventually add a codepen link) and continue with [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/), 2nd challenge - *JS + CSS Clock*.

**Thoughts:** Recently I took [CSSGrid Wes Bos' course](https://cssgrid.io/) and decided to use it on the Calculator App. Also added event listeners for the calculator keys. Then worked on the JS + CSS Clock challenge. Took the same approach of last challenge, paused the video and made my own version. Got stuck on the hour but eventually came with a solution. Tomorrow, I will watch the solution video and compare code. ***Need to look for a way to reset the degrees from 360 to 0 without jumping. Right now they're increasing indefinetly.***

### R1D3: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed JS + CSS Clock jumping issue and implemented 2 user stories of the [Calculator App] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator)

**Thoughts:** After watching the solution video of the JS + CSS Clock, I realized the issue that I was dealing, *reset the degrees from 360 to 0 withput jumping*, wasn't fixed on the final version. So I felt glad that I could come with some sort of solution, maybe is not the best approach but at least is not doing that move.

*Calculator App Coming Soon*

### R1D4 April 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started to read [Designing for Performance](http://designingforperformance.com/) *by Lara Callender Hogan*, and worked on the Calculator App

**Thoughts:** Now I can do any operation between multiple numbers with single digit but after the 3rd number, if it has more than one digit doesn't work. Also added a new input to show all the chain operations.

### R1D5 April 8, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Couldn't work in any code. Continue reading [Designing for Performance](http://designingforperformance.com/)

### R1D6 April 9, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished Web Develop Bootcamp, I was missing the last section. Also made some changes to the final project [YelpCamp](https://yelpcamp-jbf.herokuapp.com/). 

**Thoughts:** I would come back to the final section on wdbc since it's about JS OOP, keyword this and closures. Also I will be using the YelpCamp to test any new learned topic.

### R1D7 April 10, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked in the 3rd (Css Variables) and 4th (Array Cardio Day 1) Challenges of [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). Afterward, continue with the [Calculator App] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator) 

**Thoughts:** Since I wasn't able to successfully implement the chaining calculation, went to the web and found out RPN *([Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation))* is a good way to tackle this issue. So started to implement it but got problems with negative numbers. The Array Cardio Day 1 exercise was a great because allowed me to better understand array methods, still need more practice.

### R1D8 April 11, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked in the Calculator App RPN implementation

**Thoughts:** I was managed to allow negative numbers and substract operation. Still have issue with decimal numbers as result and then use it in the operation chain.

### R1D9 April 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Made 2 more challenges from Javascrip30, Flex Panel Gallery and Type Ahead. Fixed decimal issue and enabled the period in the Calculator App.

**Thoughts:** Need to work more with Array and String methods such as filter, match, includes, etc. Also I would start the css course that bought from Udemy, so I can understand better flexbox and transitions. 
Calculator App logic is almost done. Struggle with delimit the numbers after the period. Want to implement a delete button which deletes each character enter. Need to refactor and change the look & feel.

[Type Ahead](https://github.com/julisbf/JavaScript30/tree/master/06%20-%20Type%20Ahead)

### R1D10 April 13, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started CSS The Complete Guide in Udemy and worked in the Calculator App.

**Thoughts:** Delimited the numbers after the period. When testing the App, found that negative numbers or substract operation are not working. After analized my code and tried different approaches, came with a possible solution that will be implemented in these days. Hopefully it will work.

### R1D11 April 14, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked in the Calculator App.

**Thoughts:** After working a couple of hours in the App, I decided to make some changes. Changed the way am managed the input data and used split() instead of match(), since getting the right RegExp was changing another outcomes. Now it is working but if starts with a negative number, it doesn't. I will redo the operators handler. 

### R1D12 April 16, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished the Calculator App.

**Thoughts:** Finally I got my calculator working. Changed the layout and posted in Codepen.

### R1D13 April 17, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked in 2 challenges from Javascript30 and afterward, watched CSS The Complete Guide course in Udemy. Then retook Nodejs module from FreeCodeCamp. Completed HTTP Collect exercise.

**Thoughts:** Both challenges helped me to grasp more into Arrays and Canvas. Still need to check more about Canvas, eventually will come back. And the CSS course clarified some properties funcionality, such as box-sizing.

## R1D14 April 18, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished Node.js and Express.js module in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I struggle a little bit with Node.js exercises because thought I had to do something more complicated. Since I recently finished Web Development Bootcamp, was more easy to do the exercises but also helped me to understand better basic things from Node.js. 

## R1D15 April 19, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started the Pomodoro Clock from FreeCodeCamp. Then worked on Git and MongoDB modules, and finished them.

**Thoughts:** Had some issues with a couple of exercise from the MongoDB module. They were outdated, so needed to look for a solution in the web. It was a good way to reinforce what I learned on the WDBC course.

## R1D16 April 20, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Added a task name field to the Pomodoro Clock and saved every input (session length, break time & task name) into localStorage.

**Thoughts:** At first I thought in using service workers and indexedDB, but it was so complicated that it didn't worth it for 3 fields. Then looked for localStorage and realized it was better for my main purpose, keep user's last selected preferences.

## R1D17 April 22, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Read Design for Performance. Tried to implement digital numbers with CSS on the Pomodoro Clock.

**Thoughts:** Wanted to create a digital clock with CSS but I think it can have performance issues, so maybe I will do it with a digital font.

## R1D18 April 23, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked in 2 challenges from Javascript30, *Hold Shift & Check Checkboxes and Custom Video Player*.

**Thoughts:** Learned how with an mouse event you can check if shift is press down. Also can do it with alt, ctrl, or metakeys (On Macintosh keyboards, command key (⌘). On Windows keyboards, this is the windows key (⊞)). On the custom video player, understood how fullscreen needs to be handle.

## R1D19 April 24, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Watched some videos from CSS - TCG in Udemy and Jen Simmons [Layout Land YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag). Afterward, started to work on CSS Grid idea from Jan Tschichold.

**Thoughts:** Still need to practice with more examples. The idea is to start with simple layout without grid and then mobile-first approach. I really enjoyed doing it. Tomorrow I will work on the mobile-first layout.

## R1D20 April 25, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with the CSS Grid idea, finished and published in Codepen.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to work in the next layout.

## R1D21 April 26, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started with the Pomodoro design, tried different ideas with css grid, color combinations and layouts.

**Thoughts:** I just gathered different design ideas. In the other hand, I received an invitation from [Jen Simmons](http://labs.jensimmons.com/), designer advocate at Mozilla, to join CSS Layout Club.

## R1D22 April 27, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with the layout for the Pomodoro.

**Thoughts:** Wanted to do something more interactive, so came across with Braile Alphabet and focused my idea on that. Grids for the name are ready. Tommorrow will work on the numbers.

## R1D23 April 28, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with the Pomodoro Clock.

**Thoughts:** Implemented the counting with dots, showing each number on its Braile equivalent.

## R1D24 April 29, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with the layout for the Pomodoro.

**Thoughts:** Changed the whole look and feel. Chose the scheme color and typography. Need to work on the responsive desgin.

## R1D25 April 30, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with the layout for the Pomodoro.

**Thoughts:** Reorganized some elements from the layout and started with the responsive design. Still need to work on that.

## R1D26 May 01, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Watched CSS - TCG and CSS Layout Land videos. Continue with the layout for the Pomodoro.

**Thoughts:** Started to understand BEM convention. Will be applied on the Pomodoro project.

## R1D27 May 02, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with the layout for the Pomodoro. Started with the responsive design. 

**Thoughts:** For next time, I should begin with the smallest one that works in browser and afterward start to add more funcionality.

## R1D28 May 03, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Layout for the Pomodoro is almost done.

**Thoughts:** Clock layout works in different sizes but now break time is broken. Also want to change the background color depend on what clock is doing, session or break.

## R1D29 May 04, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Fixed issue when switching between session to break time. Added background color change depends on the task, session or break time. Started to read an article about how to use Git by Francesco Agnoletto, [How to not f-up your local files with git](https://medium.com/@francesco.agnoletto/how-to-not-f-up-your-local-files-with-git-part-1-e0756c88fd3c)

**Thoughts:** After reading the article, I understood that if I manage my commits as he suggested, I will be more clear with my steps and thoughts.

## R1D30 May 06, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue to read the 2nd and 3rd part of Francesco Agnoletto's article, [How to not f-up your local files with git part 2](https://medium.com/@francesco.agnoletto/how-to-not-f-up-your-local-files-with-git-part-2-fc4e243be02a) and [part 3](https://medium.com/chingu/how-to-not-f-up-your-local-files-with-git-part-3-bf03b27b6e64). Also watched a couple of videos from Layout Land by Jen Simmons

**Thoughts:** Definitely I need to start applying what Francesco is talking in his article for a better understanding of my commits. 

## R1D31 May 07, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Refactored and uploaded my Pomodoro Clock in Codepen. Watched more videos from Layout Land

**Thoughts:** Need to add comments to my code, but first I will do some research to see what is a good practice.

## R1D32 May 08, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started an exercise with CSS Grid recreating a Mike Joyce poster. Did Javascript30 exercise 12 and watched exercise 13

**Thoughts:** Using Dev Tools to change layout setup, you can get some interting ideas.

## R1D33 May 09, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Redo the CSS Grid layout. Finished chapter 3 of Designing for Performance.

**Thoughts:** Images are the ones which increase page load time. "Schedule a routine check for your site to see what images can be reused, combined, or re-exported in a different format". And also reducing their request help to reduce page load time.

## R1D34 May 10, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started with Vue.js course in Udemy. Watched Getting Started and using VueJS to Intereact with the DOM.

**Thoughts:** In the last exercise point 4, it was confusing that you need it to leave empty the input in order to have a false statement, since the DOM returns a string and not a boolean. Still all the manipulation is a little confused but I think with more practice will get used it. Looking forward to build something with it.

## R1D35 May 11, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with Vue.js course in Udemy. Watched Using Conditionals and Rendering Lists.

**Thoughts:** Understood how to use conditionals and also how to looping through lists or objects. In the last exercise I had to combine conditionals and looping.

## R1D36 May 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started to read Chapter 4 from Designing for Performance, Optimizing Markup and Styles.

**Thoughts:** After everything I have read in this book, it's a good guidance when am working in any web project. 

## R1D37 May 13, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Watched last episode season 1 of CSS Layout Land.

**Thoughts:** Layouts not need to be boring anymore. CSS grid allows us to create different layouts, not just the column ones. 

## R1D38 May 15, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Went to a meetup and had my first pair programming.

**Thoughts:** I attended a meetup where the topica was about *Recursion*, after the explanation with had a pair programming session. We did 2 exercises. For the 1st exercise, I was the driver and in the 2nd one the navigator. Being the navigator wasn't easy but after all it was just my first time. I will have more opportunities in the Chingu Vogaye 5. 

## R1D39 May 16, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with VueJS course, The Monster Slayer.

**Thoughts:** On this project I decided to codealong with Max since I wanted a better understanding of the way VueJS works. I think now it's more clear and am ready to try it in the next course project.

## R1D40 May 17, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Attended a meetup of WWC.

**Thoughts:** On that day we worked in different algorithms. It was fun because we were 5 people trying to resolve algorithms. Everyone was sharing its own point of view. I definitely will attend another one. 

## R1D41 May 18, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with VueJS course, Real development workflow with Webpack and Vue CLI.

**Thoughts:** I had to create a single layout using multiple components, locally or globally.

## R1D42 May 21, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with VueJS course, Introduction with Components. My Chingu team was assigned :)

**Thoughts:** I went back to a previous assignment where I separated every part of the layout in different components and then added them on single component, the parent.

## R1D43 May 22, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with VueJS course, Communication between Components and Advanced Component Usage.

**Thoughts:** It's amazing how VueJS simplifies many steps in the interaction implementation. Sometimes is a little confuse but with practice, I think it will have more and more sense

## R1D44 May 23, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with VueJS course, Second course project - Wonderful Quotes. First meeting with my Chingu's team

**Thoughts:** I watched the video of the assigment but didn't code. Just thougth how am going to implement it.

## R1D45 May 24, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with VueJS course, Wonderful Quotes Project. Pair programming metting and voting day

**Thoughts:** I was confused on what I needed to start, so decided to code along Max. Sometimes I did it before seeing the solution. Need to finish it. And with my programming partner, we figured which platform to use and stablished our roadmap for the TicTacToe. 

## R1D46 May 25, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Continue with VueJS course, Wonderful Quotes. Javascript30 localStorage exercise #15. 1st meeting with Chingu Team 

**Thoughts:** I finished the project but want to apply that on another mini project, maybe my portfolio. In the localStorage exercise, I used atomic commits so I get used to it. Also added the extra the delete and select buttons, as Wes Bos suggested.

## R1D47 May 27, 2018
**Today's Progress**: 2nd meeting with Chingu Team. 

**Thoughts:** At the meeting we discussed insights about our coming project. Tools and stack that we are planning to use. 

## R1D48 May 28, 2018
**Today's Progress**: 3rd meeting with Chingu Team. Watched videos about Minimax algorithm.

**Thoughts:** At the meeting we continued to think in our app functionality, and figured out how to approach it.

## R1D49 May 29, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Watched videos about Minimax algorithm.

**Thoughts:** I want to do the Tic Tac Toe game, so looked for approaches and came across with the Minimax and Alpha Beta algorithms. Now I need to understand how to apply them.

## R1D50 May 30, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started to setup our Chingu's project.

**Thoughts:** When you don't have graphic to help you understand what you have to do, it's really difficult to begin a project. We have many ideas but don't how exactly share them. 

## R1D51 May 31, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Changes on GitHub and Cloud9 for Chingu's project

**Thoughts:** After tried to setup our GitHub with Cloud9, decided to create a new workspace and start over again. At this point, we can do that but later will be difficult. Still many stuff to do. This is just the beginning
