# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/), 1st challenge - Drum kit. *Also getting used to **Markdown***

**Thoughts:** I've been using JQuery, so I decided to try build little projects with vanilla js, and found Javascript30. I listened to the objective and then paused the video to come with my solution. Checked MDN web docs to refresh some concepts and complete the challenge. Afterwards watched the solution video, and learned a new way to *access element attributes* (this one I decided to use it on my solution) and *transitionend event*. Good way to be ready for the Calculator App.

### R1D2: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started with *Calculator App* (eventually add a codepen link) and continue with [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/), 2nd challenge - *JS + CSS Clock*.

**Thoughts:** Recently I took [CSSGrid Wes Bos' course](https://cssgrid.io/) and decided to use it on the Calculator App. Also added event listeners for the calculator keys. Then worked on the JS + CSS Clock challenge. Took the same approach of last challenge, paused the video and made my own version. Got stuck on the hour but eventually came with a solution. Tomorrow, I will watch the solution video and compare code. ***Need to look for a way to reset the degrees from 360 to 0 without jumping. Right now they're increasing indefinetly.***

### R1D3: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed JS + CSS Clock jumping issue and implemented 2 user stories of the [Calculator App] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator)

**Thoughts:** After watching the solution video of the JS + CSS Clock, I realized the issue that I was dealing, *reset the degrees from 360 to 0 withput jumping*, wasn't fixed on the final version. So I felt glad that I could come with some sort of solution, maybe is not the best approach but at least is not doing that move.

*Calculator App Coming Soon*

### R1D4 April 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started to read [Designing for Performance](http://designingforperformance.com/) *by Lara Callender Hogan*, and worked on the Calculator App

**Thoughts:** Now I can do any operation between multiple numbers with single digit but after the 3rd number, if it has more than one digit doesn't work. Also added a new input to show all the chain operations.

### R1D5 April 8, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Couldn't work in any code. Continue reading [Designing for Performance](http://designingforperformance.com/)

### R1D6 April 9, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished Web Develop Bootcamp, I was missing the last section. Also made some changes to the final project [YelpCamp](https://yelpcamp-jbf.herokuapp.com/). 

**Thoughts:** I would come back to the final section on wdbc since it's about JS OOP, keyword this and closures. Also I will be using the YelpCamp to test any new learned topic.

### R1D7 April 10, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked int the 3rd (Css Variables) and 4th (Array Cardio Day 1) Challenges of [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). Afterward, continue with the [Calculator App] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator) 

**Thoughts:** Since I wasn't able to successfully implement the chaining calculation, went to the web and found out RPN *([Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation))* is a good way to tackle this issue. So started to implement it but got problems with negative numbers. The Array Cardio Day 1 exercise was a great because allowed me to better understand array methods, still need more practice.

### R1D8 April 11, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked in the Calculator App RPN implementation

**Thoughts:** I was managed to allow negative numbers and substract operation. Still have issue with decimal numbers as result and then use it in the operation chain.

### R1D9 April 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Made 2 more challenges from Javascrip30, Flex Panel Gallery and Type Ahead. Fixed decimal issue and enabled the period in the Calculator App.

**Thoughts:** Need to work more with Array and String methods such as filter, match, includes, etc. Also I would start the css course that bought from Udemy, so I can understand better flexbox and transitions. 
Calculator App logic is almost done. Struggle with delimit the numbers after the period. Want to implement a delete button which deletes each character enter. Need to refactor and change the look & feel.

[Type Ahead](https://github.com/julisbf/JavaScript30/tree/master/06%20-%20Type%20Ahead)

### R1D10 April 13, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started CSS The Complete Guide in Udemy and worked in the Calculator App.

**Thoughts:** Delimited the numbers after the period. When testing the App, found that negative numbers or substract operation are not working. After analized my code and tried different approaches, came with a possible solution that will be implemented in these days. Hopefully it will work.
