# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/), 1st challenge - Drum kit. *Also getting used to **Markdown***

**Thoughts:** I've been using JQuery, so I decided to try build little projects with vanilla js, and found Javascript30. I listened to the objective and then paused the video to come with my solution. Checked MDN web docs to refresh some concepts and complete the challenge. Afterwards watched the solution video, and learned a new way to *access element attributes* (this one I decided to use it on my solution) and *transitionend event*. Good way to be ready for the Calculator App.

### R1D2: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started with *Calculator App* (eventually add a codepen link) and continue with [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/), 2nd challenge - *JS + CSS Clock*.

**Thoughts:** Recently I took [CSSGrid Wes Bos' course](https://cssgrid.io/) and decided to use it on the Calculator App. Also added event listeners for the calculator keys. Then worked on the JS + CSS Clock challenge. Took the same approach of last challenge, paused the video and made my own version. Got stuck on the hour but eventually came with a solution. Tomorrow, I will watch the solution video and compare code. ***Need to look for a way to reset the degrees from 360 to 0 without jumping. Right now they're increasing indefinetly.***

### R1D3: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed JS + CSS Clock jumping issue and implemented 2 user stories of the [Calculator App] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator)

**Thoughts:** After watching the solution video of the JS + CSS Clock, I realized that the issue that I was dealing, reset the degrees from 360 to 0 withput jumping, wasn't fixed on the final version. So I felt glad that I could come with some solution, maybe is not the best approach but at least is not doing that move.
