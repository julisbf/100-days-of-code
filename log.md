# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/), 1st challenge - Drum kit. *Also getting used to **Markdown***

**Thoughts:** I've been using JQuery, so I decided to try build little projects with vanilla js, and found Javascript30. I listened to the objective and then paused the video to come with my solution. Checked MDN web docs to refresh some concepts and complete the challenge. Afterwards watched the solution video, and learned a new way to *access element attributes* (this one I decided to use it on my solution) and *transitionend event*. Good way to be ready for the Calculator App.

### R1D2: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started with *Calculator App* (eventually add a codepen link) and continue with [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/), 2nd challenge - *JS + CSS Clock*.

**Thoughts:** Recently I took [CSSGrid Wes Bos' course](https://cssgrid.io/) and decided to use it on the Calculator App. Also added event listeners for the calculator keys. Then worked on the JS + CSS Clock challenge. Took the same approach of last challenge, paused the video and made my own version. Got stuck on the hour but eventually came with a solution. Tomorrow, I will watch the solution video and compare code. ***Need to look for a way to reset the degrees from 360 to 0 without jumping. Right now they're increasing indefinetly.***

### R1D3: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed JS + CSS Clock jumping issue and implemented 2 user stories of the [Calculator App] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator)

**Thoughts:** After watching the solution video of the JS + CSS Clock, I realized the issue that I was dealing, *reset the degrees from 360 to 0 withput jumping*, wasn't fixed on the final version. So I felt glad that I could come with some sort of solution, maybe is not the best approach but at least is not doing that move.

*Calculator App Coming Soon*

### R1D4 April 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started to read [Designing for Performance](http://designingforperformance.com/) *by Lara Callender Hogan*, and worked on the Calculator App

**Thoughts:** Now I can do any operation between multiple numbers with single digit but after the 3rd number, if it has more than one digit doesn't work. Also added a new input to show all the chain operations.

### R1D5 April 8, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Couldn't work in any code. Continue reading [Designing for Performance](http://designingforperformance.com/)

### R1D6 April 9, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished Web Develop Bootcamp, I was missing the last section. Also made some changes to the final project [YelpCamp](https://yelpcamp-jbf.herokuapp.com/). 

**Thoughts:** I would come back to the final section on wdbc since it's about JS OOP, keyword this and closures. Also I will be using the YelpCamp to test any new learned topic.

### R1D7 April 10, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked in the 3rd (Css Variables) and 4th (Array Cardio Day 1) Challenges of [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). Afterward, continue with the [Calculator App] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator) 

**Thoughts:** Since I wasn't able to successfully implement the chaining calculation, went to the web and found out RPN *([Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation))* is a good way to tackle this issue. So started to implement it but got problems with negative numbers. The Array Cardio Day 1 exercise was a great because allowed me to better understand array methods, still need more practice.

### R1D8 April 11, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked in the Calculator App RPN implementation

**Thoughts:** I was managed to allow negative numbers and substract operation. Still have issue with decimal numbers as result and then use it in the operation chain.

### R1D9 April 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Made 2 more challenges from Javascrip30, Flex Panel Gallery and Type Ahead. Fixed decimal issue and enabled the period in the Calculator App.

**Thoughts:** Need to work more with Array and String methods such as filter, match, includes, etc. Also I would start the css course that bought from Udemy, so I can understand better flexbox and transitions. 
Calculator App logic is almost done. Struggle with delimit the numbers after the period. Want to implement a delete button which deletes each character enter. Need to refactor and change the look & feel.

### R1D10 April 13, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started CSS The Complete Guide in Udemy and worked in the Calculator App.

**Thoughts:** Delimited the numbers after the period. When testing the App, found that negative numbers or substract operation are not working. After analized my code and tried different approaches, came with a possible solution that will be implemented in these days. Hopefully it will work.

### R1D11 April 14, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked in the Calculator App.

**Thoughts:** After working a couple of hours in the App, I decided to make some changes. Changed the way am managed the input data and used split() instead of match(), since getting the right RegExp was changing another outcomes. Now it is working but if starts with a negative number, it doesn't. I will redo the operators handler. 

### R1D12 April 16, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished the Calculator App.

**Thoughts:** Finally I got my calculator working. Changed the layout and posted in Codepen.

### R1D13 April 17, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Worked in 2 challenges from Javascript30 and afterward, watched CSS The Complete Guide course in Udemy. Then retook Nodejs module from FreeCodeCamp. Completed HTTP Collect exercise.

**Thoughts:** Both challenges helped me to grasp more into Arrays and Canvas. Still need to check more about Canvas, eventually will come back. And the CSS course clarified some properties funcionality, such as box-sizing.

## R1D14 April 18, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished Node.js and Express.js module in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I struggle a little bit with Node.js exercises because thought I had to do something more complicated. Since I recently finished Web Development Bootcamp, was more easy to do the exercises but also helped me to understand better basic things from Node.js. 

## R1D15 April 19, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started the Pomodoro Clock from FreeCodeCamp. Then worked on Git and MongoDB modules, and finished them.

**Thoughts:** Had some issues with a couple of exercise from the MongoDB module. They were outdated, so needed to look for a solution in the web. It was a good way to reinforce what I learned on the WDBC course.

## R1D16 April 20, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Added a task name field to the Pomodoro Clock and saved every input (session length, break time & task name) into localStorage.

**Thoughts:** At first I thought in using service workers and indexedDB, but it was so complicated that it didn't worth it for 3 fields. Then looked for localStorage and realized it was better for my main purpose, keep user's last selected preferences.
