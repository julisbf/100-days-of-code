# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/), 1st challenge - Drum kit. *Also getting used to **Markdown***

**Thoughts:** I've been using JQuery, so I decided to try build little projects with vanilla js, and found Javascript30. I listened to the objective and then paused the video to come with my solution. Checked MDN web docs to refresh some concepts and complete the challenge. Afterwards watched the solution video, and learned a new way to *access element attributes* (this one I decided to use it on my solution) and *transitionend event*. Good way to be ready for the Calculator App.
